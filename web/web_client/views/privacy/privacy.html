            That is why we have adopted this Privacy Notice.  This Privacy Notice lets you know how and for what
            purposes we are collecting, processing, and using your Personal Information (as defined herein).  We pledge

            collected and/or owned by us, including but not limited to the CIZO website located at www.cizo.com and the

            online features, services, and/or programs we offer (collectively, the “Web Properties”).  Notwithstanding

            This Privacy Notice also applies to information collected by or for us through a means other than the Web
            Properties.  If the same information is collected through the Web Properties and through a means other than
            the Web Properties, the terms of this Privacy Notice shall apply.

            Your use of the Web Properties is also governed by the Terms of Use located at <a ui-sref="terms">Terms of Use</a>.

            <h3>Types of Information Collected</h3>

            CIZO may collect two types of information when you visit the Web Properties: personal information and usage
            information.
            <br>

            <b>Personal Information</b>: In order to participate in certain features, services and/or programs of the Web
            Properties, we may require that you provide us with certain specific information, which we may collect
            including, among other similar types of information (collectively, <u>“Personal Information”</u>): (1) contact
            information (e.g., name, address, phone number, email address); (2) demographic information (e.g., date of
            birth); (3) bank account and credit/debit card numbers; (4) resume information (e.g., education, work and
            military history, legal work eligibility status); and (5) your physical location.
            <br>
            <b>Usage Information</b>: We may obtain non-individualized, generic information about you when you visit the Web
            Properties.  This may include your (i) Internet Protocol (or IP) address, protocol and sequence information;
            browser language; browser type; domain name system requests; browsing history (including time spent at a
            domain, time and date of your visit); number of clicks; hypertext transfer protocol headers; application
            client and server banners; and operating system fingerprinting data (collectively, <u>“Browsing Information”</u>);
            and (ii) MAC address, device ID/UDID, or similar device-specific code used for advertising/marketing tracking purposes.
            <br>

            <h3>How Information Is Collected</h3>

            We may collect Personal Information and Browsing Information about you from the following sources:
            <ul>
                <li>information we receive from you, or on your behalf, through forms you complete, or if you contact us, for example to raise a query;</li>
                <li>information we receive from you through the Web Properties, such as when creating an account;</li>
                <li>information we receive when you download and register for the App;</li>
                <li>information we receive from your computer or mobile device;</li>
                <li>information we receive from our partners or service providers; and</li>
                <li>information we receive from other sources, as permitted by applicable laws, rules and regulations.</li>
            </ul>

            We may sponsor promotions through the Web Properties.  Your participation is entirely voluntary.  You may
            be asked to provide personally identifiable information including, but not limited to, your name or email
            address, or to answer questions in order to participate.  We may also transfer Personal Information to
            certain advertising or marketing partners from whom you have requested to receive information.
            <br>

            <h3>Additional Ways that Information is Collected Through the Web Properties</h3>

            <b>Browser Log Files</b>: Our servers automatically log each visitor to the Web Properties and collect and record
            certain Browsing Information about each visitor.  The Browsing Information reveals nothing personal about
            the user and includes only the generic information described in the definition of “Browsing Information.”
            We may use this information to examine our traffic in the aggregate, but we do not collect and evaluate
            this information for individuals.
            <br>
            <b>Cookies</b>: From time to time, we and/or our advertisers or other third parties may send a “cookie” to
            your computer.  A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to your Internet browser from a web server
            and stored on your computer’s hard drive and that can be re-sent to the serving website on subsequent
            visits.  A cookie, by itself, cannot read other data from your hard disk or read other cookie files already
            on your computer.  A cookie, by itself, does not damage your system.  We, our advertisers and other third
            parties may use cookies to identify and keep track of, among other things, those areas of the Web Properties
            and third party websites that you have visited in the past in order to enhance your next visit to the Web
            Properties.  Our advertisers may also use cookies to ascertain how many times that you have seen an advertisement
            and obtain similar analytical information.  You can choose whether or not to accept cookies by changing the
            settings of your Internet browser, but some functionality of the Web Properties may be impaired or not
            function as intended if you choose not to accept cookies.  See the “Third Party Opt Out” section below.
            <br>
            <b>Web Beacons</b>: Some of our web pages and electronic communications may contain images, which may or
            may not be visible to you, known as Web Beacons (sometimes referred to as ‘clear gifs’). Web Beacons collect
            only limited information that includes a cookie number; time and date of a page view; and a description of
            the page on which the Web Beacon resides.  We may also carry Web Beacons placed by third party advertisers.
            These Web Beacons do not carry any Personal Information and are only used to track usage of the Web
            Properties and activities associated with the Web Properties. See the “Third Party Opt Out” section below.
            <br>
            <b>iBeacons and Geolocation</b>:  While using certain features of one or more of the Web Properties, we may
            in the future choose to track the physical location of your mobile device or web browser to send you
            information that is relevant to you.  You will always have control over whether to transmit your physical
            location, and you can prevent such disclosure by disabling Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, declining the request to
            share your location, or adjusting your privacy settings in your mobile device operating system
            (as applicable).
            <br>
            <b>Unique Identifier</b>: We may assign you a unique internal identifier to help keep track of your future
            visits. We use this information to gather aggregate demographic information about our visitors, and we use
            it to personalize the information you see on the Web Properties and some of the electronic communications
            you receive from us.  We keep this information for our internal use, and this information is not shared
            with others.
            <br>
            <b>Third Party Opt Out</b>: Although we do not presently do so, in the future we may allow third-party
            companies to serve advertisements and/or collect certain anonymous information when you visit the Web
            Properties.  These companies may use non-personally identifiable information (including, but not limited to,
            click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over)
            during your visits to the Web Properties in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely
            to be of greater interest to you.  These companies typically use a cookie or third party Web Beacon to
            collect this information. Through these technologies, the third party may have access to and use such
            non-personalized information about your online usage activity.

            <h3>Use of Personal Information</h3>

            The Personal Information that we collect may be used for five main purposes:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    to enable the features of the Web Properties, including, but not limited to: (a) operating any
                    promotions in which you may participate; (b) setting up and managing your online or mobile
                    application account, including, but not limited to, our processing your requests for information;
                    and/or (c) providing services to you;
                </li>
                <li>
                    to improve the Web Properties by determining which of our features and services are most popular.
                    We may analyze your information and usage information to enable us and our affiliates to provide
                    services to you and develop new features, functionality, and services and otherwise for our
                    internal business purposes;
                </li>

                    to personalize your experience on the Web Properties;
                </li>
                <li>
                    to communicate with you and to inform you about our and third parties’ products and services.
                    We and/or any of our third party service providers may send you and keep you updated with
                    information about existing and new services, products, and special offers, by email, telephone,
                    mail or by means of any other contact details you provide to us or our affiliates, or to such
                    third party service providers; and
                </li>
                <li>
                    to license, sell, or share your Personal Information to non-affiliated third party companies
                    whose products and services we believe that you may enjoy.  You may, at any time, opt out of us
                    sharing your Personal Information for such purposes by contacting us as described below in
                    “Choices With Your Personal Information.”
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>When Information Is Disclosed</h3>

            We might also disclose Personal Information and/or Browsing Information when required by law or in the
            good-faith belief that such disclosure is necessary to: (1) comply with legal processes and applicable
            law; (2) enforce this Privacy Notice; (3) take precautions against liability and to respond to any claim
            that any material, document, image, graphic, logo, design, audio, video, TV clip or trailer, movie clip
            or trailer, and any other information provided to, from or on the Web Properties by you violates the rights
            of third parties; (4) assist government enforcement agencies; or (5) protect our rights, property, or the
            safety or the rights, property, or personal safety of our visitors and the public.
            <br>
            We use reasonable precautions to keep the information that is disclosed to us secure.  We may provide
            Personal Information and Browsing Information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, and other
            businesses or persons for the purposes of processing such information on our behalf and promoting the
            goods and services of our trusted business partners, some or all of which may store some or all of your
            information on servers outside of the United States.  We require that these parties agree to process such
            information in compliance with our Privacy Notice or in a similar, industry-standard manner, and we use
            reasonable efforts to limit their use of such information and to use appropriate confidentiality and
            security measures.  The use of your information by one of our trusted business partners may be subject
            to that party’s own Privacy Notice.
            <br>
            We may share Browsing Information with third parties to demonstrate the usage patterns for advertisements,
            content, functionality, promotions, and/or services on the Web Properties and/or on third party websites.
            <br>
            We reserve the right to transfer your Personal Information, as well as any information about or from you,
            in connection with the merger, sale or other disposition of all or part of our business and/or assets.
            We cannot make any representations regarding the use or transfer of your Personal Information or other
            information that we may have in the event of our bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, receivership,
            or an assignment for the benefit of creditors, and you expressly agree and consent to the use and/or
            transfer of your Personal Information or other information in connection with any of the above described
            proceedings.  Furthermore, we cannot and will not be responsible for any breach of security by any third
            parties or for any actions of any third parties that receive any of the information that is disclosed to us.

            <h3>Account, Password and Security</h3>

            For certain features available through the Web Properties, we may require the use of encryption technologies
            provided for your protection and/or account.  We use reasonable precautions to protect the privacy of your
            password and account information.
            <br>
            You, however, are ultimately responsible for protecting your password and account information from
            disclosure to third parties, and you are not permitted to circumvent the use of required encryption
            technologies.  You agree to: (1) immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your password and/or any
            other breach of security; and (2) ensure that you log out from your account at the end of each session.
            While we may provide certain encryption technologies and use other reasonable precautions to protect your
            confidential information and provide suitable security, we do not and cannot guarantee or warrant that any
            information transmitted through the Internet is secure, or that such transmissions are free from delay,
            interruption, interception, or error.

            <h3>Employment Opportunity Information Collection</h3>

            For individuals interested in job opportunities with us, the Web Properties allow prospective employees
            to request additional job opportunity information and apply for a job online.  The Web Properties may be
            used to collect Personal Information from prospective employees for human resources recruitment purposes.
            By submitting any of the foregoing information, you consent to its dissemination to, and use by, us and
            our affiliates.  The foregoing also applies to job application inquiries and submissions that you may
            transmit to us other than through the Web Properties.

            <h3>Information From Children</h3>

            We do not collect Personal Information from any person that we know to be under the age of thirteen (13).
            Specifically, the Web Properties are not intended or designed to attract children under the age of
            thirteen (13).  To access and view certain Content for mature viewers, you will need to affirm that you
            are more than eighteen (18) years of age, or an emancipated minor, or possess legal parental or guardian
            consent, and are fully able and competent to enter into the terms, conditions, obligations, affirmations,
            representations, and warranties set forth in this Privacy Notice, and to abide by and comply with this
            Privacy Notice. In any case, you affirm that you are over the age of thirteen (13), as THE WEB PROPERTIES
            ARE NOT INTENDED FOR CHILDREN UNDER THIRTEEN (13) WHO ARE UNACCOMPANIED BY THEIR PARENTS OR LEGAL GUARDIANS.
            <br>
            Parents and legal guardians should be aware that this Privacy Notice will govern our use of Personal
            Information, but also that information that is voluntarily given by children – or others – in email
            exchanges, bulletin boards or the like, may be used by other parties to generate unsolicited communications.
            We encourage all parents to instruct their children in the safe and responsible use of their Personal
            Information while using the Internet.

            <h3>Privacy Outside the Web Properties</h3>

            The Web Properties may now or in the future contain links to other websites, including, but not limited
            to, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, and contain advertisements of third parties.  We are not and cannot
            be responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any of those websites.  Other than under
            agreements with certain reputable organizations and companies, and except for third party service
            providers (as described in this Privacy Notice), we do not share any of the Personal Information that
            you provide to us with any of the websites to which the Web Properties links, although we may share
            aggregate, non-personally identifiable information with those other third parties.  Please check with
            those websites in order to determine their privacy policies and your rights under them.

            <h3>European Union Users</h3>

            If you are visiting us from the European Union, please note that we may collect, transfer, and continue
            to use your Personal Information outside the European Union for any of the purposes described in this
            Privacy Notice.  By using the Web Properties and providing us with your Personal Information, you consent
            to our collection, transfer, and continued use of your Personal Information in accordance with this
            Privacy Notice.

            <h3>Information Security</h3>

            We take reasonable efforts to ensure that information collected through the Web Properties is not lost,
            misused or altered inappropriately by administering security measures.  However, all information accessible
            and/or transferred over the Internet can potentially be accessed by unauthorized parties; therefore, we
            cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to the Web Properties.

            <h3>Choices With Your Personal Information</h3>

            Whether you submit any Personal Information to us is entirely up to you.  You are under no obligation to
            provide Personal Information.  However, this information is essential for the provision and quality of
            some of the services we offer to you, so we cannot provide you with certain services if you choose to
            withhold requested information, including, but not limited to, accessing any content on the Web Properties
            if you are not over the age of thirteen (13), and accessing certain content on the Web Properties that
            is restricted to users over the age of eighteen (18).
            <br>
            You may choose to prevent us from disclosing or using your Personal Information under certain circumstances
            (“opt out”).  You may opt out of any disclosure or use of your Personal Information for purposes that are
            incompatible with the purpose(s) for which it was originally collected or for which you subsequently gave
            authorization by notifying us by one of the methods at the end of this Privacy Notice, or by following
            the procedures set forth in an electronic communication from us, if applicable.  Furthermore, even where
            your Personal Information is to be disclosed and used in accordance with the stated purposes in this
            Privacy Notice, you may elect to opt out of such disclosure to and use by a third party that is not
            acting as our agent.  There are some uses from which you cannot opt out, such as to provide services
            that you have requested from us.
            <br>
            Please note that opting out of the disclosure and use of your Personal Information as a prospective
            employee may prevent you from being hired as an employee to the extent you are using the Web Properties
            to apply for an open position.
            <br>
            When you download the App, you may be able to manage how your mobile device shares certain information
            with us by adjusting your mobile device’s privacy or security settings.  In particular, you may elect
            whether to share location information with our mobile application to access the mobile application’s
            location based services.

            <h3>Access and Correction</h3>

            Please contact us in the manner specified at the end of this Privacy Notice to access your

            <h3>Your California Privacy Rights</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Under California’s “Shine the Light” law, California residents who provide certain personally
                    identifiable information in connection with obtaining products or services for personal, family,
                    or household use are entitled to request and obtain from us (once a calendar year) information
                    about the customer information we shared (if any) with other businesses for their own direct
                    marketing uses.  If applicable, this information would include the categories of customer
                    information and the names and addresses of those businesses with which we shared customer
                    information for the immediately prior calendar year (e.g., requests made in 2016 will receive
                    information regarding 2015 sharing activities, if any).
                </li>
                <li>
                    To obtain this information, please send an email message to app@cizo.com with “Request for
                    California Privacy Information” in the subject line and in the body of your message.  We will
                    provide the requested information to you at your email address in response.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Please be aware that not all information sharing is covered by the “Shine the Light” requirements,
                    and only information on covered sharing will be included in our response.
