# API Documentation

### Overview

The API documentation is written in [Swagger](http://swagger.io/) and is viewable using interactive documentation generated by [Swagger's code generator](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen). This interactive documentation is served locally using expressjs.

### Setup

Run 

```
./bin/setup
```

This does the following:
- Installs homebrew
- Installs swagger-codegen
- Installs Node.js

### Generating Documentation

After changing the swagger.yaml file, validate that it is correct by using the [Swagger Editor](editor.swagger.io/#/). Once validated, generate new documentation by running 

```
./bin/generate
```

### Viewing

The interactive documentation can be started by running 

```
./bin/run
```
