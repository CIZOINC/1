However, all information accessible\n            and/or transferred over the Internet can potentially be accessed by unauthorized parties; therefore, we\n            cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to the Web Properties.\n\n            <h3>Choices With Your Personal Information</h3>\n\n            Whether you submit any Personal Information to us is entirely up to you.  You are under no obligation to\n            provide Personal Information.  However, this information is essential for the provision and quality of\n            some of the services we offer to you, so we cannot provide you with certain services if you choose to\n            withhold requested information, including, but not limited to, accessing any content on the Web Properties\n            if you are not over the age of thirteen (13), and accessing certain content on the Web Properties that\n            is restricted to users over the age of eighteen (18).\n            <br>\n            You may choose to prevent us from disclosing or using your Personal Information under certain circumstances\n            (“opt out”).

Furthermore, even where\n            your Personal Information is to be disclosed and used in accordance with the stated purposes in this\n            Privacy Notice, you may elect to opt out of such disclosure to and use by a third party that is not\n            acting as our agent.  There are some uses from which you cannot opt out, such as to provide services\n            that you have requested from us.\n            <br>\n            Please note that opting out of the disclosure and use of your Personal Information as a prospective\n            employee may prevent you from being hired as an employee to the extent you are using the Web Properties\n            to apply for an open position.\n            <br>\n            When you download the App, you may be able to manage how your mobile device shares certain information\n            with us by adjusting your mobile device’s privacy or security settings.

To access certain features, Content and/or User Content available through the Web\n                    Properties, we recommend that you sign up by using your Facebook login account information.
